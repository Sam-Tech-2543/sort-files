# sort-files
### Sorts all the files in current directory.

##### Usually we don't keep our Files properly in the sorted way. 
There are many images, videos, audio files, programming files, datasets in the same folder and to find a particular file becomes clumsy.
Manually adjusted all the files is also tedious and people like me just wanted the things to be automated.
So I have made a program that just sorts all the files.

If we want to sort the folder Downloads then just put the sort_files.py file in that folder.
Running it by command __ python sort_files.py __ will sort all the things.
And then you are good to go and finding the files is much easier.
