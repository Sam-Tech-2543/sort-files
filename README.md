# sort-files
## Sorts all the files in current directory.

 Usually we don't keep our Files properly in the sorted way. 
 There are many images, videos, audio files, programming files, datasets in the same folder and to find a particular file becomes clumsy.
 Manually adjusting all the files is too tedious and people like me just want the things to be automated.
 So I have made a program that just sorts all the files.

> Putting the file in the required Folder


 If we want to sort the folder Downloads then just put the *sort_files.py* file in that Downloads folder.
 Running it by command *python sort_files.py* will sort all the things.
 And then you are good to go and finding the files is much easier.
