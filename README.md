# sort-files
### Sorts all the files in current directory.
---
Usually we don't keep our Files properly in the sorted way. 
There are many images, videos, audio files, programming files, datasets in the same folder and to find a particular folder becomes clumsy.
So Manually adjusted all the files is tedious and people like me just wanted the things to be automated.
